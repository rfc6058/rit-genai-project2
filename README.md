Project 2 - AI-assisted coding/development

This project has three apps that we made using generative AI. 

The first is a password manager, written in Python.

The second is a TOTP generator (in `./rn-version`) that has a JS backend for a basic authentication system and a react native frontend. The primary purpose of that project was to focus on TOTP generation. A TOTP demo video can be found [here](https://alexbeaver-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/alex_beaver_dev/EcXEvUFUbzRAoYc2sVL2MA4BB7N3sD3C6uzYvQ8WRRJzJA?nav=eyJyZWZlcnJhbEluZm8iOnsicmVmZXJyYWxBcHAiOiJPbmVEcml2ZUZvckJ1c2luZXNzIiwicmVmZXJyYWxBcHBQbGF0Zm9ybSI6IldlYiIsInJlZmVycmFsTW9kZSI6InZpZXciLCJyZWZlcnJhbFZpZXciOiJNeUZpbGVzTGlua0NvcHkifX0&e=b5sjVM).

The third is also a TOTP generator (in '/FlaskTOTP') that has a Python backend for basic authentication and Flask to host the service with an HTML/CSS frontend. The primary purpose was the same as the JS TOTP but with a different implementation approach using AI. Read the README located inside the folder to read more about this project.
